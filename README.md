# EA-Based-Simulation
A program simulating a three way matching between the members of three sets: a set of men, a set of women and a set of dogs based on an evolutionary algorithm.

Compilation Instructions:
Compile all .java files.

How to Run the Program:
Double click ex12Q2.jar.

More Info:
The program always runs for a total of 3 minutes.

From the "Preference List Generation" combo box you can change whether you want a sequence of runs to use the same randomly generated preference list or use a different list at the start of each run.

Ticking/Un-ticking the "Crossover Enabled" checkbox controls whether crossover is applied when creating offpsring.

Filling in a value in the "Number of Runs" field pre-orders a certain number of runs to run consecutively as a sequence.

Filling in a value in the "Time Between Generations" field controls how long in milliseconds the program waits between each pair of consecutive generations. The minimum value is 50 and the default, if the text field is left blank, is 1000.
